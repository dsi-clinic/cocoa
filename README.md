# Clinic Opinionated Codebase Oversight and Analysis

[![Cocoa Error Analysis](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/cocoa/actions/workflows/error.badges.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/cocoa/actions/workflows/error.badges.yml)


This repository was developed in order to generate automated reports on how well codebases adhere to the [coding standards](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/coding-standards) of the University of Chicago's DSI [Clinic course](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/education/data-science-clinic/).

The goals of this codebase is to provide a quick and easy way to review code and to alert contributors where their code may be failing.

## Installation

`pip install dsi-cocoa`

To install the package locally, run the following command from the root of the repository:
```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

## cocoa

This package contains a module `evaluate_repo` which runs code testing libraries against a repository. There are multiple ways that we want to be able to run this repo:

1. We want to be able to clone `cocoa` and then use it as part of their process.
2. We want administrators to be able to give it a list of repos to generate reports on all repos.
3. (Eventually) We want it to be able to run as a github action _on the repo itself_.
4. (Eventually) We want to be able to have adminstrative repo that can run it on other repos.

### How to run

Via command line:

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo
```

As a python script:

```bash
python3 src/cocoa/evaluate_repo.py /path/to/repo
```

As a Python module:

```python
from cocoa.evaluate_repo import evaluate_repo

evaluate_repo('/path/to/repo', False)
```

A few important notes:

1. Make sure to `git pull` _before_ running this code.
1. This will get branch information for all branches.
1. This will only run the analysis (`pyflakes` on python files) for the code _in the current branch_. So if you run this while your current branch is `main` it will run on `main`.

#### Options

If you want to turn on linting, add the argument "--lint":

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo --lint
```

Results are truncated by default. To print all results, use the verbose option:

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo --verbose
```

Cocoa evaluates the main branch by default. To evaluate a different branch, use the branch argument:

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo --branch branch-name
```


If files modified/created only after a certain date are to be evaluated then use the date option:

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo --date YYYY-MM-DD
```

Note: Please add date string in YYYY-MM-DD format.

All options can be combined like so:

```bash
cocoa /path/to/repo --lint --verbose --date YYYY-MM-DD
```


### Checks

The code run multiple checks on each repo. For each check run there are three possibilities:

1. WARNING: Most likely this needs to be fixed.
1. INFO: Log information for additional context.
1. ERROR: A critical issue that needs to be addressed.

For each of the checks below we have denoted what the check generates.

- Branch Hygiene:
  - [WARNING] Branch names
  - [INFO] Commit information for live branches.
- File Hygiene:
  - [ERROR] Unnecessary and cache file (such as .DS_Store or pycache files)
- Notebook Files (\*.ipynb):
  - [ERROR] Cells per notebook < 10, lines per cell < 15 and 0 functions defined
  - [ERROR] Linting: PyLint, Black, Flake and iSort
- Python Files
  - [ERROR] All Code in Functions
  - [ERROR] All functions have docstrings
  - [ERROR] Code uses off-limit libraries (subprocess)
  - [ERROR] Linting: PyLint, Black, Flake and iSort

### Github actions

There is a Github action located [here](.github/workflows/error.badges.yml) that runs `cocoa` on pushes to the main branch. The action has an associated badge that can be displayed at the top of your repo to show passing or failing status. The badge code can be copied from the raw text of this readme.

To override the `--date` or `--branch` options run in the action, create an environment named "cocoa_standards" in your repository, then create environment variables called `BRANCH_NAME` and `REVIEW_AFTER_DATE`.
